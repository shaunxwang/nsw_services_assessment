# Data Analyst Technical Assessment
This data analyst technical assessment will have you connect to a dataset using Jupyter Notebook to do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), followed by answering questions about the data and lastly creating a dashboard in Google Data Studio. 

## Details about this assessment
__Business Process__ - Management would like a detailed EDA and dashboard created from the dataset located here: https://data.nsw.gov.au/search/dataset/ds-nsw-ckan-f4e5fd07-eb6a-420c-a857-6eda213ba6a3/details

Management would like to know about the quality of the dataset, to understand some of the analysis that comes from it, and to also view a dashboard with some of the most important details.
